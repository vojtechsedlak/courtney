  - heading: Creating a Safe Environment
    text: >
      One of the most important parts of my counselling work is co-creating an
      environment where you feel safe, supported, connected, and understood. I
      know firsthand how awkward and vulnerable it can be to walk into a
      counselling office for the first time, so I try my best to make the
      experience as comfortable as possible.

  - heading: Building an Alliance
    text: I believe, and research continually shows, that the therapeutic
      relationship--the relationship between therapist and client—typically has
      the most significant impact on the outcome of therapy. Knowing this, I
      strive to build a strong, authentic alliance with my clients so that they
      feel seen and supported while exploring the range of their experience and
      working together towards their therapeutic goals.

  - heading: A Client-Centered Philosophy
    text: >
      I recognize all individuals come to counselling with different
      personalities, cultural backgrounds, needs, and past experiences—even if
      their struggles sometimes look similar from the outside. Therefore, in
      keeping with my client-centered philosophy, I work with you to blend a
      variety of counselling modalities and techniques that best suit your
      specific needs and goals.

      I warmly welcome individuals of all genders, sexual orientations, and
      cultural backgrounds.
