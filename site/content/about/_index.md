I worked as a personal chef and holistic nutritionist, helping others with their relationships with food. It was this experience, along with my own struggles with food and body, that led me to pursue a career in counselling so that I could expand and deepen my knowledge about the complex relationships we humans have with food, our bodies, and our emotions and better help people struggling with all three. 

I then went on to complete my Master of Counselling degree at City University of Seattle, 

My passion for working with youth stems from years of experience working with young people in different capacities, and from the the compassion and admiration I have for individuals navigating this stage of life that is often chock-full of challenges--challenges around identity, self-esteem, anxiety, planning for the future, navigating relationships, family transitions, and body transformations, to name a few. I thoroughly enjoy providing young people with a non-judgemental space to explore themselves as they are, as well as who they want to become.
