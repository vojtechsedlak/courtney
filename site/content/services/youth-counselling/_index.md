My ***passion for working with youth*** stems from years of experience working with young people in different capacities, from supporting youth with disabilities in community settings to counselling youth struggling with anxiety, depression and eating disorders.

The Ayesha Siddiqi quote, “Be the person you needed when you were younger,” has also guided my path to youth counselling. ***I, like so many others, struggled with my mental and emotional health*** in my youth. Through my own experience, as well as my experience working with other youth, I’ve come to appreciate how crucial it is to prioritize one's mental health from a young age. I truly believe that ***learning how to understand our emotions, manage our anxieties, and develop a healthy relationship with ourselves in our youth can set the stage for good mental health in adulthood, and for a rich and fulfilling life.***

I have so much compassion and admiration for young individuals navigating a stage of life that is inevitably chock-full of challenges—challenges around identity, self-esteem, planning for the future, and navigating relationships and family transitions, to name a few. Therefore, ***I strive to provide my young clients with a non-judgemental and supportive space for self-discovery***.
