Having struggled with disordered eating in my early twenties, I know first hand how scary, confusing, and lonely it can feel, and how difficult it can be to seek help. My ***personal experience living with and recovering from a disordered relationship with food and body*** has been a huge driving force behind the work I do with individuals struggling with eating disorders and disordered eating. 

Having made a full recovery from my own disordered relationship with food and body, ***I know how rich and full life can be when we learn to open our awareness to and liberate ourselves from the negative impacts of deeply ingrained behavioural patterns, cultural ideas of beauty and worthiness, deep-rooted emotions, past traumas, and false beliefs about ourselves.***

I offer therapeutic support to individuals across the spectrum of disordered eating as well as to individuals with clinically diagnosed eating disorders.

***My Experience***

I have always been curious about how we as humans relate to food. This curiosity has manifested itself in various ways, from food writing while at university to going to culinary and pastry school, working as a personal chef, becoming a Registered Holistic Nutritionist, and ultimately pursuing a masters in counselling with my thesis research focusing on the cultural aspects of orthorexia. 

While pursuing my counselling degree, I worked as a Holistic Nutritionist helping youth and adult clients struggling with eating disorders and disordered eating to improve their relationship with food and their bodies. As part of my masters program I completed an internship in an eating disorder program for children and youth in Port Moody, British Columbia. I also volunteer for the Looking Glass Foundation to provide support to adults in the community who are struggling with their relationship to food and body.
